# Network Security & Troubleshooting

**Welcome to Part 2 of the CompTIA Network+ course
This blog post covers two major topics of the Network+ course: **Network Security and Network Troubleshooting. 
--

## Network Security

### Common Threats and Vulnerabilities
- **DoS/DDoS**: Attacks that flood a network or system to make it unavailable.
- **Phishing**: Tricking users into revealing sensitive information via fake communication.
- **Malware**: Malicious software like viruses, worms, or ransomware that can harm systems.
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM)**: Intercepting communication between two parties to steal or manipulate data.

### Security Devices and Technologies
- **Firewalls**: Monitor and filter incoming/outgoing traffic based on security rules.
- **NAC (Network Access Control)**: A cybersecurity approach that restricts access to a network by ensuring only authorized and compliant devices and users are allowed to connect.
- **IDS/IPS**: Detects (IDS) or blocks (IPS) malicious traffic in real time.
- **SIEM**: Aggregates and analyzes security data from across the network for monitoring and alerting.

### Authentication and Access Control
- **AAA**: A framework for managing user access: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting.
- **RADIUS**: A protocol for centralized user authentication and accounting.
- **TACACS+**: Similar to RADIUS, but separates authentication, authorization, and accounting.
- **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds extra layers of security using more than one form of identity verification.

### Wireless Security
- **WPA2/WPA3**: Security protocols for wireless networks, WPA3 being the more secure and modern.
- **TKIP**: An older encryption protocol, now mostly replaced due to vulnerabilities.
- **AES**: A strong encryption standard used in WPA2/WPA3 for securing data.

### Network Segmentation and Isolation
- **VLANs**: Logically separate networks to reduce broadcast traffic and increase security.
- **Air Gaps**: Physically isolated networks with no external connections for maximum security.
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: A subnetwork that hosts external-facing services, isolated from the internal network.

## Network Troubleshooting

### Troubleshooting Methodology
1. **Identify the problem** 
2. **Establish a theory** 
3. **Test the theory** 
4. **Establish a plan** 
5. **Verify functionality** 
6. **Document findings** 

### Common Tools
- **ping**: Tests connectivity between devices.
- **traceroute**: Shows the path packets take to reach a destination.
- **ipconfig/ifconfig**: Displays IP configuration on Windows/Linux systems.
- **nslookup**: Queries DNS to resolve domain names.
- **netstat**: Displays active connections and listening ports.

### Common Issues
- **IP conflicts**: When two devices on the same network have the same IP address.
- **DNS issues**: Problems resolving domain names due to misconfigured or unavailable DNS servers.
- **Cabling problems**: Faulty or disconnected cables can cause intermittent or total network failure.
