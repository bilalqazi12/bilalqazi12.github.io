## 1. Incident Response Steps

When a security incident happens (like a data breach), we follow these steps to handle it:

- **Preparation:**  
  Make a response plan before anything bad happens. Train your team and set up tools.
  
- **Identification:**  
  Detect and confirm that an incident has occurred (using alerts, logs, etc.).

- **Containment:**  
  Stop the threat from spreading â€” like isolating infected systems.
<!--more-->
- **Eradication:**  
  Remove the root cause of the attack (delete malware, patch vulnerabilities).

- **Recovery:**  
  Restore systems and services back to normal and monitor them.

## 2. Digital Forensics Basics

Digital forensics helps us investigate cybercrimes by collecting and analyzing digital evidence.

- **Main Steps:** Collect â†’ Examine â†’ Analyze â†’ Report  
- Always follow the **chain of custody** to protect evidence.

---

## 3. SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

SIEM tools collect and analyze logs from across your network to detect threats in real time.

- **Examples:** Splunk, ELK Stack, QRadar  
- Helps in quick alerting and responding to incidents.

## 4. MITRE ATT&CK Framework

MITRE ATT&CK is a public knowledge base of how attackers behave.

- Helps defenders understand, detect, and stop threats.
- Includes tactics like initial access, privilege escalation, and exfiltration.

## 5. Risk Management

Risk management means identifying, assessing, and reducing risks in an organization.

- **Risk Types:** Cyber, physical, legal, etc.  
- **Responses:** Accept, reduce, avoid, or transfer (like using insurance).

## Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)

---

### ðŸ§¾ 6. Policies, Procedures, and Frameworks

Formal rules and structures for managing IT security.

- **ISO 27001:** Global security standard.
- **NIST:** U.S. cybersecurity guidelines.
- **COBIT:** Enterprise IT governance model.

### 7. Regulations and Laws

These are legal requirements for organizations:

- **GDPR (EU):** Protects European usersâ€™ data.
- **HIPAA (US):** Secures health-related information.
- **PCI-DSS:** Applies to credit card handling companies.

### 8. Risk Types and Responses

- Risks can be **internal** (like human error) or **external** (like hackers).
- Use security policies, tools, or insurance to handle them.

---

## 9. Security Awareness Training

- Employees are the first line of defense.
- Training teaches them to spot phishing, use strong passwords, and follow company policy.

## Summary

In this part, we learned how companies detect and respond to cyber threats, manage risk, and follow compliance rules. This is a key skillset for any cybersecurity role.
