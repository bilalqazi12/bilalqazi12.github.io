## CompTIA A+ Part #1 â€“ Basics of Hardware & Troubleshooting

### Summary for Blog Introduction:
Welcome to my first blog post! 
Iâ€™m currently learning the CompTIA A+ course, and Iâ€™m excited to share what Iâ€™ve learned so far. 
This post includes key concepts about hardware components and troubleshooting techniques, which are the foundation for anyone starting their career in IT or computer support.

## Key Topics & Points Covered:
### 1. Troubleshooting and Problem Identification
The first step in IT support is to understand and fix problems using a proper method.

ðŸ”¹ Identify the issue, ask the user questions, test possible causes, apply a solution, and then confirm the issue is fixed.
ðŸ”¹ Always document the problem and solution for future reference.

## 2. Storage Devices
Storage devices are used to save data permanently or temporarily.

ðŸ”¹ Types include HDD, SSD, NVMe, USB, CD/DVD.
ðŸ”¹ SSDs are faster than HDDs and more reliable for performance.

## 3. Processors and CPU
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer.

ðŸ”¹ It performs all calculations and instructions.
ðŸ”¹ Speed is measured in GHz, and multi-core CPUs improve performance.

## 4. Input and Output Devices
Devices that help users interact with the system.

ðŸ”¹ Input devices: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Microphone
ðŸ”¹ Output devices: Monitor, Printer, Speakers

## 5. Adapter Cards
These are small circuit boards used to add extra functionality to a computer.

ðŸ”¹ Examples: Graphics Card (GPU), Network Card (NIC), Sound Card
ðŸ”¹ Installed on motherboardâ€™s PCIe or other slots.

## 6. Understanding BIOS and CMOS
BIOS (Basic Input Output System) starts your computer and checks hardware.

ðŸ”¹ CMOS stores BIOS settings like date/time and boot order.
ðŸ”¹ BIOS setup can be accessed by pressing keys like F2, Del during boot.

## 7. Understanding the Motherboard
The motherboard connects all components of a computer together.

ðŸ”¹ It has slots and sockets for CPU, RAM, storage, adapter cards, and more.
