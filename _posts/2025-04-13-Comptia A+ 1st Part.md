## CompTIA A+ Part #1 – Basics of Hardware & Troubleshooting

## Summary for Blog Introduction:
Welcome to my first blog post! 
I’m currently learning the CompTIA A+ course, and I’m excited to share what I’ve learned so far. 
This post includes key concepts about hardware components and troubleshooting techniques, which are the foundation for anyone starting their career in IT or computer support.

## Key Topics & Points Covered:
### 1. Troubleshooting and Problem Identification
The first step in IT support is to understand and fix problems using a proper method.

 - Identify the issue, ask the user questions, test possible causes, apply a solution, and then confirm the issue is fixed.
 
 - Always document the problem and solution for future reference.

### 2. Storage Devices
Storage devices are used to save data permanently or temporarily.

 - Types include HDD, SSD, NVMe, USB, CD/DVD.

 - SSDs are faster than HDDs and more reliable for performance.

### 3. Processors and CPU
The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer.

 - It performs all calculations and instructions.

 - Speed is measured in GHz, and multi-core CPUs improve performance.

### 4. Input and Output Devices
Devices that help users interact with the system.

 - Input devices: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Microphone

 - Output devices: Monitor, Printer, Speakers

### 5. Adapter Cards
These are small circuit boards used to add extra functionality to a computer.

 - Examples: Graphics Card (GPU), Network Card (NIC), Sound Card

 - Installed on motherboard’s PCIe or other slots.

### 6. Understanding BIOS and CMOS
BIOS (Basic Input Output System) starts your computer and checks hardware.

 - CMOS stores BIOS settings like date/time and boot order.

 - BIOS setup can be accessed by pressing keys like F2, Del during boot.

### 7. Understanding the Motherboard
The motherboard connects all components of a computer together.

 - It has slots and sockets for CPU, RAM, storage, adapter cards, and more.
