## Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities | Architecture and Design | Implementation

Welcome to Part 1 of the **CompTIA Security+**. This blog post explains important topics for cybersecurity!

## Threats, Attacks, and Vulnerabilities

**Malware types**  
Viruses, worms, ransomware, and spyware that damage or steal from systems.

**Phishing**  
Tricking users with fake emails or messages to get personal information.

**Social engineering**  
Using human tricks (not tech) to get access to systems or data.

**DoS/DDoS attacks**  
Flooding a network or website to make it crash or slow down.

**Threat actors**  
People or groups who attack, like hackers or insider threats.

**Threat vectors**  
Ways attackers use to reach and attack systems, like emails or USBs.

**Penetration testing**  
Ethical hacking to find weak points in a system before real hackers do.

**Vulnerability scanning**  
Using tools to detect known security issues in systems.

## Architecture and Design

**Secure network architecture**  
Planning networks in a safe way to reduce attack risk.

**Cloud and virtualization security**  
Protecting data and systems running in the cloud or virtual environments.

**Secure system design**  
Building systems with security features from the start.

**Zero trust**  
Never trust anything by default â€” always verify first.

**Defense in depth**  
Using many layers of security to protect a system.

**Segmentation**  
Breaking a network into parts to stop threats from spreading.

## Implementation

**Secure protocols**  
Using safe communication methods like:

- **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP, protects data between your browser and the website.
- **SSH**: Secure protocol for remotely accessing and managing devices safely over a network.
- **SFTP**: Secure method of transferring files between computers over a network.

**Wireless security**  
Protecting Wi-Fi using strong methods like WPA3 and enterprise mode.

**Authentication and authorization**  
Checking who you are (auth) and what you can access (authz) with tools like MFA, RADIUS, LDAP.

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**  
A system that uses digital certificates to secure data and identity.

**Network and host security**  
Using firewalls, IDS/IPS, and antivirus to protect devices and networks.
